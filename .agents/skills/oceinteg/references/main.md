# Main acceptance test

Run `oceinteg main` to prove a fresh supported installation through the
Console and a real Slack-connected Agent. Run repository commands from the
repository root. Use current supported procedures from the
[testing index](../../../../docs/testing/README.md),
[production installation guide](../../../../docs/guides/deploy/production-installation.md),
[Agent setup guide](../../../../docs/guides/deploy/production-agents.md), and
[repository installation guide](../../../../docs/guides/repository-credentials/installation.md).

This scenario sends test messages in the selected Slack channel and attempts
uniquely named disposable Git branch pushes: denied under read-only access and
verified then removed under contributor access. It also requests a disposable
Linear write that the designated human reviewer must deny. Resolve the targets
and existing authorization before those actions. Do not open PRs, merge, force-push, alter protected refs, or change
unrelated installations. Use only test-owned resources.

Read [Runtime and isolation acceptance](./runtime-acceptance.md) before setup;
its cases are required in addition to the SWE Agent checks below. Execute
its Standard Codex baseline before the SWE Agent, then its remaining cases.

## Resolve inputs before provisioning

Reuse inputs already supplied by the user; ask only for missing decisions. Record
nonsecret selections in the run report. Never record credential values.

| Input                   | Required selection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topology                | Resolve “two clusters”: two Kubernetes clusters or two OCE Namespaces. Record provider, region when applicable, exact contexts, release names, and which scenarios run on each. Helm installs into clusters; it does not create them. Do not infer cloud-creation authorization from an ambiguous count.                                                                                                                                          |
| Images and source       | Choose a compatible published release or operator-supplied custom immutable controller/runtime/broker images. Record source revision, chart version, image digests, architecture, and runtime provenance. Resolve “latest” once; fail explicitly if no compatible published pair is available.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Model authentication    | Resolve existing credentials and supported models for both runtimes. For a Codex service-account token, select dedicated Codex and Console **Service Accounts** (`codex_pat`); separately resolve the OpenClaw provider credential. Do not silently substitute an API key or another account when authentication, quota, or model access fails.                                                                                                   |
| Slack                   | Resolve the supplied credential item to its app-level and bot tokens without printing either. Record workspace, bot identity, channel ID, and authorized test sender. Confirm app subscriptions/scopes and channel membership. Run selected QA consumers sequentially. Record existing consumers; use a dedicated identity unless the user explicitly authorizes sharing. Preserve other consumers and correlate replies to the exact QA session. |
| GitHub App              | Obtain operator-supplied App ID, installation ID, private-key reference, numeric repository IDs, and approved `git-read` policy for both repositories below and contributor policy for the separate positive-write case. Keep inputs protected and outside chart values and Agent configuration.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Linear                  | Supply the selected workspace, a known readable issue, and a selected Codex account that already has Linear connected for the selected plugin. Catalog visibility or an enabled badge alone is not authentication proof.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Browser access          | Supply Console URL, operator login, native UI domain and certificate, and the required routing/cookie-domain inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ownership and retention | Record a run ID, disposable branch names, owned infrastructure and resource IDs, evidence directory outside the checkout, timeouts, and whether successful resources should be retained. Preserve unrelated state and the default kubeconfig/context.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Credential-store item names are private runtime inputs, not repository defaults.
Use the host's supported credential tooling. Never expose credentials in commands,
logs, screenshots, transcripts, or reports, and never manually handle refresh
tokens. Credential failures block affected assertions; they are not permission
to weaken security or switch identities.

Before accessing a credential store or entering values in Console, follow
[Supply credentials](./credentials.md) for field selection, protected retrieval,
and the supported binding steps.

## Installation acceptance

Record a separate result for each selected topology and follow its setup:
[EKS with Helm OCC](./setup-eks.md), [k3d with Helm OCC](./setup-k3d.md),
[k3d with Compose OCC](./setup-compose-k3d.md), or the
[OpenShift/OpenShell test setup](./setup-openshift.md). Never transfer a pass across
topologies. The default Compose-only preview cannot deploy Agents; the explicit
Compose/Kubernetes profile is distinct and requires additional setup. Record
its documented capability differences without counting substitutes as passes.
The OpenShift setup covers a dedicated Codex test path; its CLI provisioning
does not satisfy this scenario's Console-only requirement or replace the other
acceptance checks below.

Use the selected installation procedure with the following acceptance profile:

- Enable standard presets and the **SWE Agent** preset from
  `deploy/presets/swe-preset.json`. Verify the expected preset names in the Console of each selected OCE
  Namespace. Verify later Namespace seeding and that rerendering/reconciliation
  preserves an existing customized preset.
- For the Codex installation, select `drivers.plugin.id: codex-plugin` with
  `drivers.plugin.configuration.catalogSource: openai-curated`. Verify the
  selected controller supports that catalog and the selection survives rerenders.
- Enable Envoy routing and native UI. Complete the
  [workspace routing](../../../../docs/guides/deploy/workspace-routing.md) and
  [native admin prerequisites](../../../../docs/guides/deploy/native-admin.md),
  including DNS, trusted HTTPS, Gateway API/controllers, scoped RoleBindings in
  both data-plane and Gateway namespaces, and reviewed Codex seccomp on eligible
  nodes. For EKS, follow its actual network/storage prerequisites; local k3d
  results do not establish EKS readiness.
- Exercise a fresh broker-omitted case: no App inputs are required, installation
  succeeds, and no broker workload or repository grant is created. Then exercise
  the configured case through the documented enablement path or a separate fresh
  release, according to the selected topology. Do not silently enable it.
- For the configured case, derive the origin and certificate DNS SAN from the
  rendered chart. Verify CA trust, Git routing, and the exact broker hostname in
  the effective Codex allowlist. Retain TLS validation, repository authorization,
  explicit network denies, `mode = "full"`, and `allow_local_binding = true`.
  Keep workspace sandboxing enabled; full network mode does not mean full
  filesystem access. Do not reintroduce patched private-endpoint capabilities.

Use real compatible runtime images and an isolated fresh database. Fixture
controllers, preexisting repaired deployments, and Helm rendering alone cannot
satisfy installation acceptance. Test both release and custom-image selection
paths if claiming support for both; otherwise name the untested path.

## Provision through Console only

Infrastructure, chart bootstrap, and operator-owned installation inputs may use
their documented CLI procedures. After bootstrap, perform all Agent creation,
credential binding, permission selection, plugin selection, channel settings,
and deployment through the Console. Read-only API, Kubernetes, and provider
inspection may verify outcomes. A required SQL write, direct API mutation, pod
patch, or manual runtime-file repair fails the Console-only criterion.

1. Start creating `ted-backup` using **SWE Agent** (the actual preset
   name), with the selected service-account authentication and dedicated Codex
   runtime. If that name already exists, do not overwrite it; resolve an
   isolated target.
2. Configure the user-selected test channel using its exact ID; use `claw-test`
   for the QA checklist run, or another explicitly selected channel.
   The preset starts without configured channels. Verify the selected channel
   is in the saved allowlist after saving. Set no-mention
   handling and reply-in-thread behavior explicitly through supported controls.
3. Bind both `openclaw/openclaw-enterprise` and `openclaw/openclaw` with the
   Console's shared **Read-only** access level (`git-read`). Select permissions
   explicitly; do not infer them from the App's installation repository list or
   Console defaults. Current Console repository selection uses one profile for
   every selected repository; per-repository mixed profiles are future scope.
4. Resolve the role configured for this run before creating the Agent. The SWE
   Agent instructions limit its repository authority and state that only verified
   instructions from Kevin or Peter may change its scope. Obtain one of their
   verified instructions for this acceptance run. It must name the run ID,
   `openclaw/openclaw-enterprise`, `openclaw/openclaw`, and the unique disposable
   branch for each repository. It may authorize only a harmless local commit and
   one non-force push attempt of each named branch for the write-denial probe; it
   does not authorize a pull request, merge, protected-ref change, or any other
   write. In **Advanced settings** -> **Workspace files**, append that exact
   instruction to the initial `AGENTS.md` without replacing the preset's other
   instructions. After deployment, reload `AGENTS.md` and verify the exact text.
   If the file cannot be saved or read back, block the probe. This run-specific
   instruction does not change the preset or grant broader repository authority.
   Do not add an instruction that tells the model to refuse repository writes or
   otherwise substitutes prompt behavior for credential enforcement. Denial
   evidence must come from the broker or Git error of a real attempted push
   against each selected repository, not from model behavior.
5. Enable Linear from the curated catalog only after confirming the selected
   Codex account already has Linear connected for the chosen workspace. Preserve
   the configured role's instruction to read, not change, Linear items; that
   instruction is not provider-enforced read-only access. If the account is not
   connected, record a credential blocker before provisioning rather than
   proceeding through a nonexistent Console authentication flow.
6. Deploy. Require the selected revision to become active, its real workloads to
   become Ready, and a genuine model turn to succeed. Reload Console and confirm
   saved selections. Record the Agent and revision IDs for later attribution.

## Exercise the real Agent

Use an authorized human sender for the no-mention test, unless the user explicitly
selected and configured a bot sender. Existing
[Slack fixture settings](../../../../docs/testing/slack.md) require mentions and
override reply mode; that fixture is not proof of this scenario.

| Check                         | Required evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unmentioned channel message   | Send a relevant top-level question without mentioning the bot. Receive an answer from the selected Agent in that message's thread, with matching `thread_ts` and no stray top-level response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Thread follow-up              | Send an unmentioned follow-up in the same thread. Verify a contextual reply in the same thread from the same Agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Linear                        | Ask for the known permitted issue. Verify a real successful Linear tool call and accurate issue identity, title/status, and link. The preset's graceful fallback is useful behavior but is not a passed Linear test. `PLUGIN_AUTH_REQUIRED`, an unconnected account, or missing workspace consent is a blocked Linear test, not a Console step to complete during provisioning.                                                                                                                     |
| Repository reads              | From Slack, request sandboxed clone/fetch and harmless read-only inspection of both `openclaw/openclaw-enterprise` and `openclaw/openclaw`. Verify native tool execution and independently read back the exact remote commit or file identity for each repository. No host-run Git command may substitute for the Agent operation.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Repository write denial       | Using the exact run-specific instruction and branch names from step 4, request the harmless local commit and one non-force push attempt for each selected repository. Require a broker or Git authorization denial, not a model refusal, missing credential, timeout, DNS failure, or broken Git command. Independently confirm each remote ref stayed absent or unchanged. If any push unexpectedly succeeds, record the product failure and remove only that owned ref after verifying ownership. |
| Broker and sandbox boundaries | Confirm valid TLS to the rendered host, wrong-host/untrusted-CA rejection, an explicit Codex domain deny with a positive reachability control, and denied out-of-workspace writes with a writable positive control. Distinguish client-side refusal from server-side authorization. When needed, use a separately identified trusted observer probe with valid scoped credentials to establish broker denial; do not expose those credentials to the model or report.                               |
| Native Control UI             | Launch from the selected Agent's Console action. Require authenticated content, a live connection, a harmless read, and successful reload. Verify an unauthenticated browser cannot reach Agent content. Opening an empty tab is not a pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Persistence                   | Redeploy once through Console. Verify saved repository permissions, plugin and channel settings, then repeat a Slack/model response and Control UI launch. Verify working state survives the expected lifecycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Keep each assertion tied to its actual installation, Agent revision, Slack
thread, and Git ref. If two targets are selected, state exactly which assertions
ran on each. Do not generalize one target's results to the other.

## Diagnose, clean up, and report

Follow the owning setup docs without unrecorded workarounds. Maintain a deviation
log: documented step and source revision, observed failure, classification,
workaround, owning code/doc fix, and clean rerun result. A repaired live setup
alone does not prove the original documented path. Fix authorized deviations;
otherwise leave explicit follow-up work and mark acceptance of the documented setup incomplete.

Set bounded deadlines before execution. Classify failures as product, harness,
infrastructure, or credentials using observed evidence. Do not weaken assertions
or repair the running Agent outside Console to obtain a pass. If a fix is within
the task's authorization, retain the failed evidence and rerun the affected
supported path from a clean state; otherwise report the blocker.

After an uncertain write-denial attempt or transport timeout, independently
inspect provider state before retrying. Never blindly replay a push. Verify
ownership and the current ref SHA before deleting only unexpectedly created
run branches. Stop the test Agent
through Console and verify runtime/material cleanup before removing owned
installation resources, unless the user requested retention. Do not falsify
repository disposal state or delete unknown historical cleanup records. Preserve
Slack evidence links; do not delete shared messages without explicit scope.

Return an acceptance matrix with **passed**, **failed**, **blocked**, **not
run**, or **unsupported** for every required check, topology, and runtime. Include
all cases from the required runtime checklist, even when credentials block them.
Use unsupported only for a documented product boundary; it is never a pass. Include source/chart/image identities,
actual commands, Console screenshots or walkthrough, Slack links, sanitized tool
evidence, remote Git readback, failures/retries, and cleanup or retained-resource
status. State verification limits, particularly local versus EKS proof. A blocked
or unrun required assertion makes the overall scenario incomplete.
