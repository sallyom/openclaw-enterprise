# OpenShell tests

Verify provider-owned Codex execution and OpenShell filesystem and network
enforcement. Prepare [credentials](README.md#requirements-and-credentials)
and use the suite-specific infrastructure below.

## Start a reusable development environment

Use the [local Kubernetes OpenShell profile](../guides/deploy/local-kubernetes-development.md#start-the-openshell-fail-closed-profile)
for an ordinary OpenClaw Enterprise development stack. That profile starts the
real control plane, Gateway, and operator Workspaces. It prepares the supported
fail-closed Agent path but does not create an Agent.

Create the private Kubernetes-only OpenShell `v0.1.3-pre.1` environment from the
repository root:

```sh
pnpm cli:build
export OCC_DEVELOPMENT_COMPUTE_DRIVER=kubernetes
export OCC_DEVELOPMENT_CONTROL_PLANE=kubernetes
export OCC_DEVELOPMENT_SANDBOX_DRIVER=openshell
./scripts/dev-up
```

The launcher uses Docker or Podman only to host k3d and build or import images.
PostgreSQL, the OCE API and worker, and OpenShell Gateway run inside the cluster.
It leaves the environment running and does not change the default kubeconfig or
context. No model credential is needed because stock v0.1.3-pre.1 cannot run the
regular Agent path.

Stop the reusable environment before proving the setup and cleanup lifecycle in
a separate fresh cluster:

```sh
./scripts/dev-down
OCC_TEST_DEV_UP_OPENSHELL_REAL=1 \
  node --test tests/integration/dev-up-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs
```

The command verifies control-plane Pods, Workspace reconciliation, and cleanup;
it does not use the compatibility bridge or perform a model turn. The reusable
environment's startup output prints its API URL, kubeconfig, context, and
service-key file without printing credential contents.

Select the alternate proof when PostgreSQL, the OCE API, and the worker must
remain in Compose:

```sh
OCC_TEST_DEV_UP_OPENSHELL_COMPOSE_REAL=1 \
  node --test tests/integration/dev-up-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs
```

This case verifies the real Compose-backed control plane, Gateway NodePort,
operator Workspace, and combined Compose and cluster cleanup. It uses the same
disposable-cluster and no-model-turn boundary as the Kubernetes-only case.

The OpenShell CI lane runs this lifecycle through `scripts/dev-up` and
`scripts/dev-down` before its credentialed Sandbox case.

Remove the owned environment when finished:

```sh
./scripts/dev-down
```

Cleanup permanently deletes this helper's cluster and in-cluster database. A
partial setup remains recorded for safe cleanup; run `down` before retrying. Set
the absolute `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_STATE_DIRECTORY` before every command to keep
multiple checkouts separate. Set `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker` or
`podman` when automatic engine selection is ambiguous.

This launcher does not start a supported production Installation or an
interactive OCC Agent. The credentialed compatibility experiment remains the
separate real Sandbox suite below.

## OpenShell Sandbox

This suite needs the owned OpenShell CI recipe: a disposable K3s v1.36.4 k3d
cluster, matched kubectl, the selected RuntimeClass bound to the cluster's
`runc` handler, a successful RuntimeClass smoke Pod, Agent Sandbox
CRDs/controller, Helm, the OpenShell chart source, imported immutable OpenShell
gateway, sandbox runtime, and supervisor images, real gateway/Codex images, the
Kubernetes test database, `openssl`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The standard k3d recipe alone is
insufficient because it does not install the CI-owned admission config,
RuntimeClass, Agent Sandbox, or OpenShell assets.

For CI-shaped setup, let `prepare.mjs` create the pinned K3s cluster, install
OpenShell prerequisites, and export the lane environment before
`run-tests.mjs` invokes the case:

```sh
export OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_SECRET_PROJECTION=1
node scripts/ci/prepare.mjs \
  --lane openshell \
  --state "$RUNNER_TEMP/state/openshell.json" \
  --github-env "$GITHUB_ENV"
node scripts/ci/run-tests.mjs run openshell \
  --state "$RUNNER_TEMP/state/openshell.json" \
  --results "$RUNNER_TEMP/results/openshell.json"
```

Hosted CI runs the default Codex case. To run the native case the same way,
also export `OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_HARNESS=openclaw`.

For manual setup, prepare these inputs using the
[OpenShell test settings](#openshell-test-environment) and
[OpenShell requirements](../reference/drivers/openshell-sandbox.md#kubernetes-and-admission-requirements),
then run the exact file:

```sh
OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_K3D_REAL=1 \
  node --env-file="$TEST_ENV_FILE" --test tests/integration/sandbox-driver-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs
```

Both modes compose the `openshell` Backend with the Sandbox and Credential
Gateway Drivers. They register an `openai` credential source through the
production API from an OCC Secret holding `OPENAI_API_KEY`, check its live
`ready` status, and bind the Agent with `credential_source`. The Agent service
principal receives `operate` on the source only, not on the Secret.

Set `OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_SECRET_PROJECTION=0` for the stock fail-closed proof. It
passes the production requirements to v0.1.3-pre.1 unchanged and expects the Driver to
reject the `APP_SERVER_TOKEN` Secret projection before the candidate can
activate. The model key no longer appears among the rejected entries. This does
not prove provider authentication or model execution.

Set the selector to `1` for the verification-only compatibility proof. The
strict CI runner forwards the selector and accounts for one stable test identity
in either mode. The positive scenario uses a test-only operator Job to stage the
app-server token, plugin-runtime files, and projected workload token in
revision-specific PVC subpaths before OpenShell starts the provider-owned
Harness. The same bridge mounts writable revision subpaths for runtime assets,
workspace-node state, and the native state root `/home/node/.openclaw`, where
the Agent entrypoint publishes plugin skills. Kubernetes Compute backs the
whole Harness home with an emptyDir. The Job no longer receives the model key. The test asserts that Compute
rendered no `OPENAI_API_KEY` and exactly one credential attachment, and that
every Harness process holds only an `openshell:resolve:env:` placeholder, so the
real model turn proves that the supervisor proxy substituted the key. The Driver asks OpenShell to expose the app-server port in the original
Sandbox Create request. The test confirms that the returned route reaches the
protected Codex app server and that the Driver's default service authorization mode strips its bearer authorization, so the
upgrade fails with `401` instead of weakening app-server authentication. It then
runs the real model turn over the authenticated Pod-loopback endpoint. The
scenario also requires exact workload identity claims, approved mounts and
privileges, denied secret exposure, allowed and denied tool egress, replacement,
and cleanup. It separately checks the OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC) Agent Service
selector. Missing prerequisites fail rather than skip.

The Codex scenario then updates the source through the API, withdraws it from
the running Agent, waits for `revoked`, and expects the next model turn in the
same process to fail. It accepts any turn failure, so it does not yet tell a
credential rejection from a transport error or a restarted process. Full
integration lanes run only from `main`, so this proof runs after a withdrawal
change lands, not on its pull request.

`OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_HARNESS` defaults to `codex`. Select `openclaw` to verify
that the native Harness requests no inbound OpenShell service exposure and
completes a real model turn through its outbound enrolled-worker connection.
The selected network policy permits provider egress from the Codex executable
for Codex or from the Node executable for native OpenClaw. Native enrollment
egress uses the Workspace Gateway's configured endpoint port, including the
high loopback port allocated by the Podman verification relay. The real fixture
also gives the delegated Sandbox the same 2 GiB Harness memory limit as
Kubernetes Compute; the cluster's 1 GiB container default is insufficient while
the native worker installs its Gateway bundle.

Use an OCE runtime image built from the OpenClaw source commit pinned by
`deploy/runtime/Dockerfile`. The native proof requires the environment-managed
`connect --ephemeral` path; OCE supplies its one-use enrollment target through a
private file instead of a process argument. The Codex workspace-node proof still
requires the `node run --pair-if-needed` and `--commands` CLI options. The test
configures the private Gateway with its fully qualified `.svc.cluster.local`
hostname so OpenShell policy DNS, the listener certificate, the HTTPRoute, and
node pairing use the same name.

### Native OpenClaw with k3d

The [k3d helper](kubernetes.md#develop-with-local-containers-and-k3d) selects
the native case with `--harness openclaw`:

```sh
./scripts/k3d test --harness openclaw
./scripts/k3d demo --harness openclaw
```

`test` and `demo` use the same verification-only compatibility bridge; it does
not promote that bridge into a supported production path.

This selection prepares the pinned OpenShell lane, builds the sibling
`../openclaw` checkout, and records its commit with the prepared environment.
Set `OCC_K3D_OPENCLAW_SOURCE` to another absolute source checkout. Codex and
native OpenClaw use separate helper-owned state. `demo` keeps the proven topology
running after its real turn, opens the Control UI's new-session flow and the OCC
console on loopback, and prints its isolated integration username instead of
using the development login. It leaves the dedicated worker slot free, so the
first browser session uses the dedicated-native profile without the Gateway
receiving the Harness's model credential.

Without `--harness`, `copy` selects the one active demo and `down` removes both
helper-owned Harness environments; pass `--harness codex` or
`--harness openclaw` to select one.

### Test bridge and upstream prerequisite

The integration uses an operator-owned Helm wrapper to install the OpenShell
gateway before delegating to the Driver. The bundled Driver does not install
that gateway. Stock OpenShell `v0.1.3-pre.1` cannot receive the required app-server
token `secretKeyRef`, plugin-runtime ConfigMap, or projected workload identity
through its gateway configuration.

The fixture gives that gateway its own scoped DNS/API access. Ordinary Harness
DNS comes from Compute. Gateway callback policies select the OpenShell supervisor
labels (`openshell.ai/managed-by=openshell`, `openshell.ai/boundary-role=supervisor`)
in both directions, because the supervisor, not the Harness, calls the gateway.
The fixture installs no namespace-wide DNS or callback grant, and the test
requires the provider Harness Pod to carry `provider-fenced-v1`, which receives
no Compute egress grant. Older fixtures
may retain broad policies or Sandbox templates without the profile. Inspect
their ownership and replacement routes before removing stale policies, or
recreate the disposable fixture. Reusing a Sandbox by name does not update its
template.

Positive Codex mode selects the Driver's explicit test-cluster compatibility
bridge through the regular Agent workflow. Native OpenClaw mode retains the
fixture-only bridge. The bootstrap Job
mounts the app-server token Secret reference, immutable `runtime.json` and
`config.toml` ConfigMap entries, and an audience-bound ServiceAccount token. It
copies them into private PVC subpaths. The compatibility request mounts the
credentials, plugin runtime, and workload token read-only; Agent-owned node
state, revision-owned runtime assets, and the Harness workspace remain writable.
The node identity survives revision retirement so replacements reconnect to the
Gateway without redeeming the same setup code again. For native
OpenClaw, the bridge mounts node state at a root-level path because stock
OpenShell runs the Agent as UID 10001 while the runtime image owns `/home/node`
as UID 1000; this keeps secure workspace-transfer ancestry owned only by root or
the effective Agent user. The bridge moves the native inference workspace grant
to the same root so authorization remains exact. Helm permits
the OpenShell supervisor Pod to reach Envoy only from the Gateway-attached
tenant namespace because the supervisor owns the policy-enforced outbound
socket. The verification-only Gateway enables caller driver configuration and
disables v0.1.3-pre.1 resource admission because this bridge attaches OCE-owned PVCs
without OpenShell approval labels. The Enterprise Driver still restricts the
request to its approved Harness mounts. This setting is not a supported
production path. The Driver omits the service authorization mode, so OpenShell also removes the
`Authorization` header before forwarding an exposed service request, while the
Codex app server accepts only bearer authorization. The integration therefore
proves exposed-route reachability and app-server rejection separately from its
authenticated in-Sandbox model turn. Production still rejects the original
requirements. See the
[production contract](../reference/drivers/openshell-sandbox.md#current-upstream-preconditions)
and the [pre.5 experiment handoff](openshell-pre5-local-experiment.md).

Local `sandbox-driver-startup`, `controller-lifecycle`, and
`postgres-platform-state` integration tests cover driver selection and Backend
membership, revision lifecycle, and persistence. The
`credential-source-occ`, `openshell-gateway-wire`, and `kubernetes-compute`
conformance tests cover credential source admission, provider RPC encoding, and
Compute's credential-source rendering. None of these exercises the real
OpenShell tools.

### Development profile

The opt-in development-profile integration installs PostgreSQL and OCE with
Helm in the owned k3d cluster, installs the checksum-pinned OpenShell assets,
and verifies the bootstrap Namespace, RuntimeClass, Agent Sandbox API,
deployment Gateway, operator label, workspace ServiceAccount, and actual
matching Workspace through the Gateway API. It then creates another
OCC Namespace and verifies that the Driver applies the same ServiceAccount and
creates its matching Workspace without another Helm release. In that
Namespace it uses the checkout-local `occ` CLI to register a synthetic `openai`
credential source, reads its live `ready` status, finds the matching provider in
the Namespace's OpenShell Workspace, creates a `credential_source` IAM Role, and
deletes the source, which removes the provider:

```sh
OCC_TEST_DEV_UP_OPENSHELL_REAL=1 \
  node --test tests/integration/dev-up-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs
```

The Driver, rather than a per-Namespace Helm release, applies the rendered
workspace-chart resources before creating the Workspace. The case requires an
executable checkout-local `bin/occ`, Docker or Podman, k3d, kubectl, Helm, and
network access to the pinned sources and images. Set
`OCC_TEST_DEV_UP_CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman` to select a prepared Podman engine.
It creates unique cluster, state, API, and Kubernetes port names and removes
only those resources. Missing selected prerequisites fail.

This case proves development orchestration, the two real charts, Driver-owned
operator resource reconciliation, Gateway Workspace creation, and the
credential-source CLI and API path. The synthetic key proves no model
authentication. It does not create an Agent or Sandbox; for the manual Agent
walkthrough, see [Use a credential source on the local OpenShell profile](../guides/deploy/openshell-credential-sources.md). The
`OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_SECRET_PROJECTION=0` real Sandbox Driver case remains the
Agent-level proof that the ordinary dedicated Codex workflow rejects unsupported
Secret projection without creating a Sandbox or Agent Pod.

## OpenShell test environment

[`sandbox-driver-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs`](../../tests/integration/sandbox-driver-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs)
is selected by `OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_K3D_REAL=1` or by setting any Kubernetes,
image, database, or OpenShell-specific prerequisite. If any of those variables
is present while the flag is not `1`, prerequisite validation still fails; use a
scoped environment file for this suite.

| `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_GATEWAY_IMAGE`       | Imported immutable real OpenClaw gateway image; `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_RUNTIME_IMAGE` is accepted as a fallback.                                         |
| `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_AGENT_IMAGE`         | Imported immutable Harness image; Codex and runtime-image fallbacks are accepted. The native selector uses the OpenClaw source image.                  |

| `OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_CHART_VERSION`        | Optional OpenShell chart version; defaults to `0.1.3-pre.1`.                                                                                           |
| `OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_RUNTIME_CLASS`        | Existing RuntimeClass used by Agent Sandbox Pods; CI creates the selected RuntimeClass, defaulting to `openshell-sandbox`, with the `runc` handler.    |

The selected cluster must already expose the Agent Sandbox CRD and a ready Agent
Sandbox controller. See the
[OpenShell SandboxDriver testing guide](#openshell-sandbox) for
the required cluster, image, database, RuntimeClass, and chart setup.

The CI bootstrap verifies the `v0.1.3-pre.1` source archive checksum, packages
the chart from that tag, and imports gateway, sandbox runtime, and supervisor
images published under the tag's commit SHA. It does not depend on prerelease
GitHub Release assets or a semver-tagged chart.
