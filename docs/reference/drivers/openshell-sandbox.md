# OpenShell SandboxDriver

The OpenShell SandboxDriver runs dedicated Codex and native OpenClaw Harnesses
with the [Kubernetes Compute Driver](kubernetes-compute.md). OCC owns Agents,
revisions, Namespaces, routing, credentials, and authorization.

**The OpenShell integration is a work in progress.** Stock OpenShell
[`v0.1.3-pre.1`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/v0.1.3-pre.1) cannot accept the
Secret-backed app-server token or projected workload identity a dedicated Agent
requires. The [OpenShell Credential Gateway](openshell-credential-gateway.md)
delivers the model API key. The Driver rejects these revisions by default. A
[test-cluster bridge](openshell-sandbox-test-bridge.md) stages the missing inputs
through a Job and PVC; it is not a production path.

OpenShell supports dedicated Harnesses; embedded OpenClaw fails. Kubernetes
Compute requires dedicated native OpenClaw to use a provisioning SandboxDriver
with networking, filesystem, and process containment. See the
[upstream requirements](#current-upstream-preconditions) before evaluating it.

## Ownership model

Stock OpenShell cannot complete dedicated Harness provisioning until it meets
the [upstream requirements](#current-upstream-preconditions). Kubernetes Compute
orchestrates the workflow:

- It creates or adopts the OpenClaw Namespace and applies baseline isolation.
- It creates the per-Agent OpenClaw Gateway and private state in the control-plane
  target, with Harness workspace storage in the data-plane target. Compute owns
  their ServiceAccounts, Services, NetworkPolicies, revision records and activation
  state. This does not move the separate OpenShell gateway.
- It calls `SandboxDriver.ensureNamespace`, when implemented, after namespace
  isolation exists.
- It delegates dedicated Harness creation to `SandboxDriver.provisionHarness`,
  when implemented; otherwise, it creates the ordinary Harness Deployment.
- It routes only to the active revision and removes routing during
  deactivation when the Service still points at that revision.

The OpenShell SandboxDriver delegates sandboxing:

- `configureAgent` contributes provider-specific gateway configuration before
  OCC validates and freezes the immutable Agent revision.
- `ensureNamespace` requires the configured workspace mode. In `operator` mode,
  it applies configured operator labels and rendered workspace-chart resources,
  then provider NetworkPolicies, before checking Gateway health and creating or
  adopting the exact OpenShell Workspace corresponding to the Kubernetes
  namespace. Adoption requires OCC's exact ownership labels and an active
  Workspace.
- `provisionHarness` asks the OpenShell gateway to create one OpenShell Sandbox
  in that Workspace. Dedicated Codex exposes its loopback app-server port in the
  same request; native OpenClaw connects outbound and requests no inbound
  service. The Driver adds each
  [credential attachment](#credential-attachments) to the Sandbox's providers,
  validates the returned service route, and returns the stable Sandbox reference.
  The Sandbox
  belongs to the AgentRevision. Its native OpenClaw node host admits the bounded,
  configured set of session-owned workers instead of creating another Sandbox
  for each session.
- OpenShell's controller creates and owns the provider Harness Pod behind that
  Sandbox.
- With `gateway.serviceRouting`, `harnessTransport` gives Kubernetes Compute
  the published WebSocket route, virtual Host, and exact NetworkPolicy peer.
  The Agent Gateway uses that route for Codex. The Driver checks that OpenShell
  returned the expected virtual Host during Sandbox creation.
- `cleanup` receives the immutable Agent revision during revision retirement and
  derives the stable provider Sandbox identity, so retirement works even when its
  Pod is gone. During Namespace deletion it receives no revision, verifies
  Workspace ownership, deletes the OpenShell Workspace, and removes configured
  workspace-chart and NetworkPolicy resources. Kubernetes Compute deletes the
  Kubernetes namespace only after that succeeds.

Compute trusts OpenShell to enforce its provider-owned Pod, then requires
workload readiness and active-revision routing before serving traffic. Each
Agent revision retains `sandboxDriverId` for provisioning and cleanup.

## OpenShell containment facets

The Driver configures all three
[SandboxDriver containment facets](sandbox.md#containment-facets):

| Facet        | Current OpenShell behavior                                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `networking` | Binary-scoped OpenShell policies for Harness tool traffic, plus Kubernetes baseline policies. |
| `filesystem` | Approved PVC subpath mounts and OpenShell filesystem policy for read-only/read-write paths.   |
| `process`    | OpenShell process policy, including the configured run-as user and group.                     |

There is no `exec` facet. Command-level authorization and per-tool dynamic
sandbox creation are deferred; `exec` remains a tool invocation that runs inside
the selected Harness sandbox.

## Configuration

Select `drivers.sandbox` in the trusted Installation startup YAML. The bundled
OpenShell SandboxDriver can only be composed with the bundled Kubernetes Compute
Driver; selecting any installed Compute Driver with `drivers.sandbox` fails
startup. It also requires an [`openshell` Backend](../backends.md#openshell-gateway)
whose `drivers.sandbox` matches this ID, and the Backend's
[Credential Gateway](openshell-credential-gateway.md#configure-the-driver) member
must be selected too. The Backend owns the gateway connection; the Sandbox
rejects `endpoint`, `scheme`, `serviceName`, `port`, `auth`,
`requestTimeoutMs`, and `rootCertificatePath` in its `gateway` block.

```yaml
drivers:
  compute:
    id: compute-kubernetes
    configuration:
      # See kubernetes-compute.md for the required Kubernetes Compute config.

  sandbox:
    id: openshell-sandbox
    configuration:
      gateway:
        workspaceMode: operator
        operatorNamespaceLabels:
          openshell.ai/openclaw-workspace: "true"
        operatorWorkspaceResources: []
        networkPolicyResources: []
      kubernetes:
        runtimeClassName: openshell-sandbox
        serviceAccount:
          mode: gatewayConfigured
        sandboxDataMount:
          subPath: workspace
          mountPath: /sandbox/enterprise
          readOnly: false
      policy:
        process:
          runAsUser: "1000"
          runAsGroup: "1000"
        networkPolicies:
          - name: source-control
            binaries:
              - path: /usr/bin/git
            endpoints:
              - host: github.com
                ports: [443]
                protocol: tcp
                tls: skip
```

The [test-cluster bridge](openshell-sandbox-test-bridge.md) requires the same
Agent ServiceAccount in the gateway and Driver. Its copied token expires;
production leaves the option unset.

For published service routing, `gateway.serviceRouting` names the published
domain and exact OpenShell Gateway Pod peer.

Do not add a policy for the model endpoint. The credential source's provider
profile allows `api.openai.com` with TLS inspection, and an uninspected rule for
the same host conflicts with it.

Each v0.1.3-pre.1 network policy requires at least one binary identity with a nonempty
executable path. OpenShell applies the endpoints only to those
binaries. For a private Service, set `allowedIps` to its exact Service VIP
CIDR; OpenShell otherwise rejects internal addresses. Use its full cluster DNS
name because the policy resolver does not apply Kubernetes search domains.
The optional endpoint fields use OpenShell's configuration spellings: `tls`
accepts `skip` or `terminate`; `enforcement` accepts `enforce` or `audit`; and
`access` accepts `read_only`, `read_write`, or `full`. OpenShell v0.1.3-pre.1 treats
`terminate` as a deprecated alias for automatic TLS detection and termination.
It also changed the old `passthrough` spelling to that behavior, so the Driver
rejects `passthrough` at startup. Replace `tls: passthrough` with `tls: skip` to
retain uninspected TLS relay.
`gatewayConfigured` is the only ServiceAccount mode for `v0.1.3-pre.1`; the
gateway's configured sandbox ServiceAccount applies to every Sandbox it creates
and does not satisfy the per-Agent production requirement below.

When readiness is configured, it observes a Service and Pods in the OCC
namespace. A deployment-paired Gateway normally uses an explicit Backend
`endpoint` instead. A configured timeout and polling interval must be positive safe
integers, and cancellation stops the wait.

The OpenShell gateway must be installed separately. The bundled driver does not
install it. `gateway.workspaceMode` is required and accepts `operator` or
`managed`. Managed mode is reserved for the future and currently fails before
the Driver mutates Kubernetes or calls the Gateway. Configure the Gateway's
Kubernetes driver with `workspaceMode: operator` and a namespace selector
matching `operatorNamespaceLabels`. In this mode the OpenShell Workspace name
must equal its pre-provisioned Kubernetes namespace, so OCC uses a stable
`oce-` name with a 15-character digest to stay within OpenShell v0.1.3-pre.1's
19-character Workspace limit.

The Kubernetes development profile acts as the operator for its disposable
cluster. With Kubernetes Compute, `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_SANDBOX_DRIVER=openshell`
installs one pinned Gateway with workspace resources disabled. The explicitly
selected Kubernetes-only control plane places it in `oce-system`; the default
Compose control plane places it in `openshell-system`.
The upstream Agent Sandbox controller remains in `agent-sandbox-system`. The helper renders the
pinned `openshell-workspace` chart once and stores its namespace-agnostic
resources in the trusted Installation configuration. For every OCC Namespace,
the Driver applies those resources before creating its Workspace through the
Gateway API. There is no per-Namespace Helm release.

The disposable profile enables OpenShell's unauthenticated development mode.
In the Kubernetes-only profile, its Gateway ingress policy admits only the OCE
API and worker in `oce-system` and OpenShell supervisor Pods from OCE-owned
tenant Namespaces. The per-tenant
callback egress policy selects only Pods labeled as OpenShell-managed
supervisors. Other tenant Pods cannot reach the Gateway administrative API.

`gateway.operatorWorkspaceResources` accepts the namespace-scoped
ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding, and NetworkPolicy objects rendered from the
workspace chart. The Driver injects the current Compute-owned namespace and OCC
ownership metadata before server-side apply. Configure this field only for
`operator` mode; managed mode never applies it. Do not include Secrets or
cluster-scoped objects.

`gateway.networkPolicyResources` accepts namespace-scoped Kubernetes resource
objects for provider networking. They are applied into the OpenClaw Namespace
during `ensureNamespace`. Do not include Secrets in this array; the driver
rejects Secret resources because OpenShell credentials must not be embedded in
startup YAML.

`kubernetes.sandboxDataMount` must match exactly one approved dedicated Harness
workspace mount. It may not mount the PVC root, may not use `..`, and must mount
under `/sandbox/`.

For dedicated Codex, OpenShell's `configureAgent` hook contributes the effective
configuration before OCC validates and freezes the revision, disabling the
inner Codex app-server sandbox:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "codex": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "appServer": {
            "sandbox": "danger-full-access"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This avoids stacking the Codex sandbox inside OpenShell. OpenShell becomes the
outer containment boundary for the dedicated Harness. Native OpenClaw already
runs with its inner runtime isolation disabled; the hook preserves its
configuration unchanged because OpenShell supplies that outer boundary. Native
session workers have separate managed workspaces, but they share the Sandbox's
user, filesystem, process, and network boundary. OpenShell isolates the
AgentRevision from other workloads; it does not isolate mutually untrusted
sessions within one Agent. Kubernetes defaults to eight retained native workers
and accepts an explicit `runtime.nativeOpenClawSessionCapacity` from `1` through
`1024`. A stopped hosted session releases its slot; idle workers are not
automatically retired.

## Credential attachments

For a revision bound to a [credential source](../credential-sources.md),
Compute passes one attachment per source in `credentialAttachments`. The Driver
appends each attachment's provider name to the static `providers` list in
`SandboxSpec`. It rejects an attachment whose name does not have the OCC
`oce-cs-` provider shape or that repeats a static provider. Startup rejects
static `providers` entries that use the OCC shape, so operator-configured
providers cannot impersonate a credential source. After the Harness is ready,
Compute requires every attachment to report `ready` before activation.

## Create-time app-server exposure

For a dedicated Codex request that reaches OpenShell, the Driver reads the literal
`APP_SERVER_PORT` prepared by Compute and includes one unnamed service exposure
in `CreateSandbox`. It uses the Agent revision UUID as OpenShell's `request_id`,
so retries receive the same service URL. The Driver accepts only an HTTP or HTTPS
origin, rewrites its port to the configured gateway endpoint for local
port-forwards, and requires a valid route before provisioning succeeds.

OCE omits `authorization_mode` by default, so OpenShell strips `Authorization`
before proxying. The explicit test-cluster `serviceAuthorizationMode` option
selects upstream v0.1.3-pre.1 `BEARER_PASSTHROUGH` for Codex. The test-cluster
bridge expects a WebSocket upgrade with the app-server token and leaves
Compute's Agent Service in place. A Sandbox without a replayable Create
receipt must be removed; the Driver does not add a later `ExposeService` call.

Native OpenClaw does not accept inbound Harness traffic. Its enrolled node host
opens the connection to the Agent Gateway, so the Driver sends an empty service
exposure list and rejects any unexpected service URL returned by OpenShell.

## Kubernetes and admission requirements

OpenShell requires an operator-installed RuntimeClass or equivalent admission
exemption for its trusted privileged components. Because Pod Security Admission
exempts the whole Pod, the cluster must also install a fail-closed admission
policy that restricts the exemption to the approved OpenShell workload shape:
trusted OpenShell images by digest, expected ServiceAccounts, approved
Namespaces, expected labels, and the exact elevated capabilities needed by
OpenShell init and supervisor components.

Do not grant wildcard tenant permissions to the SandboxDriver. It is wired to
use the same authenticated Kubernetes client as the Kubernetes Compute Driver;
there is no provider-specific Kubernetes access adapter. The
controller and worker should receive only the Kubernetes access already
required by Compute plus the OpenShell-specific ability to apply configured
namespace-scoped NetworkPolicy resources and read gateway
readiness. OpenShell creates and deletes its Sandboxes through its own gateway;
the Enterprise worker needs no Sandbox custom-resource permissions.
Namespace-scoped RBAC must enforce the tenant boundary on the shared client.

Kubernetes NetworkPolicies are additive. The Kubernetes Compute Driver still
installs default-deny and Agent routing policies; OpenShell bootstrap policies
must allow only gateway, control-plane, callback, and approved provider
connectivity needed for OpenShell to function. Broad namespace egress or ingress
allows can bypass the intended boundary.

Compute passes the provider-fenced network profile (`provider-fenced-v1`) to the
provider Harness template; the provider must retain it on the resulting Pod.
That profile admits Gateway transport ingress but none of Compute's DNS, model
or authentication egress, so OpenShell's workload fence alone governs egress. The gateway's callers are
OpenShell supervisor Pods (`openshell.ai/managed-by=openshell`,
`openshell.ai/boundary-role=supervisor`), which carry no `openclaw.dev` labels,
so gateway callback policies must select those supervisor labels rather than the
Harness profile. The separately installed OpenShell gateway needs its own scoped
DNS/API policies because it does not receive ordinary tenant DNS by omission.
Existing Sandboxes keep their template: redeploy the Agent revision to apply the
profile. See the
[network profile reference](kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md#explicit-network-profiles).

## Current upstream preconditions

Production Agent deployment still requires the following OpenShell capabilities
and Driver integration:

- OpenShell must create Sandboxes with the per-Agent ServiceAccount that Compute
  creates for the Harness.
- OpenShell must preserve the Harness's exact audience-bound, short-lived
  projected ServiceAccount token and read-only mount. Its gateway bootstrap
  token is not a substitute. Stock OpenShell `v0.1.3-pre.1` does not support
  projected volumes in gateway driver configuration. An operator-created
  template bridge is not a supported workaround.
- OpenShell must preserve all approved Agent workspace PVC subpath mounts
  without falling back to its default workspace claim or mounting the PVC root.
- OpenShell must provide the Harness's bounded Pod-local writable home, which
  Kubernetes Compute backs with an emptyDir at `/home/node`. The Agent entrypoint
  writes runtime assets there and publishes plugin skills at
  `/home/node/.openclaw/plugin-skills`.
- OpenShell must preserve the immutable plugin-runtime `runtime.json` and
  `config.toml` ConfigMap entries at `/etc/openclaw/plugin-runtime`. The Codex
  entrypoint reads these files even when the Agent selects no optional plugins.
- OpenShell must support exact environment entries backed by Kubernetes
  `secretKeyRef` for the startup app-server token Secret. Stock OpenShell
  `v0.1.3-pre.1` cannot receive those entries through the current gateway API, and the
  Enterprise Driver rejects them. A credential bridge is not a supported
  workaround. The model API key uses the Credential Gateway instead.
- OpenShell gateway authentication must be bound to the trusted caller and the
  requested Sandbox or Pod identity.
- For Codex, OpenShell service routing must securely carry bearer authorization
  without exposing gateway credentials. The test-cluster bridge selects
  upstream's `BEARER_PASSTHROUGH`; production needs the same authenticated path.

If any of these conditions are unavailable, OpenShell-selected deployments must
fail closed instead of launching an unsandboxed or incorrectly credentialed
Harness.

## Sandbox log reads

`readSandboxLogs` calls only `GetSandboxLogs`. The OCC gateway identity needs
the `sandbox:read` scope and Workspace role `user`. OpenShell `NOT_FOUND`
becomes `RUNTIME_LOGS_SANDBOX_NOT_FOUND`. See
[Agent logs](../../guides/topics/agent-logs.md#sandbox-source).

## Troubleshooting

Common fail-closed errors include:

- `drivers.sandbox requires the bundled Kubernetes Compute Driver.`
- `The bundled OpenShell drivers.sandbox requires a backend entry with type openshell.`
- `OpenShell gateway option endpoint belongs to the openshell Backend or is unsupported.`
  Move the connection settings to the Backend.
- `The Harness requires a credential attachment that this OpenShell Backend did not issue.`
- `The Sandbox did not apply a required credential attachment.` Check the
  provider's status in OpenShell.
- `OpenShell gateway Service is unavailable.`
- `OpenShell gateway Pod is not ready.`
- `OpenShell SandboxDriver supports only dedicated Codex or OpenClaw Harness revisions.`
  Deployment status reports `SANDBOX_HARNESS_UNSUPPORTED`.
- `OpenShell v0.1.3-pre.1 cannot receive secretKeyRef environment APP_SERVER_TOKEN ...`
  Deployment status reports `SANDBOX_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT_UNSUPPORTED` after one
  attempt; redeploying the same revision cannot succeed on stock `v0.1.3-pre.1`.
